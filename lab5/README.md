Lab 5: PHP Conditions and Functions

* Create an HTML page that has a form that asks the user to provide an amount for the number of dice to roll ( let's keep it to between 1 and 5 dice) and his/her guess of what the total sum of all the dice will be.

* Then, provide some feedback to the user as to whether his/her guess was accurate. (remember - check for "defaults"/outlier amounts and give user feedback in that regard also)....

* Then, create a PHP file that will take that data and process it (that is, "roll the dice"!)

* Be sure to display images of the rolled dice, and the numeric total of the dice.

Don't forget - for each assignment - place your name in the head or body section of your html code, and, on the home page of your lab assignment, at the top or the bottom of the page, place a link to a text file version of each of your .php files (save the file as abcphp.txt, for example)...
