Lab 1: SetUp and CSS 

In this lab, you will be setting up the construct for your lab assignment environment for this course; and you will also flex your muscles with uploading a website template that utilizes CSS (see notes for tips on obtaining a template).

Step 1 - choose a web host provider that supports PHP - this can be a paid environment (like GoDaddy) or a free environment (like x10Hosting) and create an account there.

Step 2 - either in your Pitt webspace or the PHP web host environment, create a folder called CS334; then in that folder create an index file that will contain a listing of links to each of your lab assignments for this course.

Step 3 - Download a website template that utilizes CSS to create a "Business-related" website (for example, "business & services", or "computing and apps" or "non-profit" or "accounting", etc.); make sure to include all graphics as appropriate, and maintain the file structure that was downloaded (images in image folder, etc); save the site, publish it to your web host environment, and submit the URL in this drop box. (One can find CSS templates in Dreamweaver and at various sites like http://designscrazed.net/free-responsive-html5-css3-templates/.)
