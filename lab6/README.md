Lab 6 - Looping and Conditions
For this lab, write code for the following scenario:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100; but for multiples of three, print "Go" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Pitt".  For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "GoPitt".

Assume that you'll be working with integers only.

Don't forget - place your name somewhere in the head or body area of your code; and place a link to a text version of your php code.
