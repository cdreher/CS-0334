Lab 9: SQL Basics

Design a customer contact database that would store at least the following data items:

last name
first name
street address 1
street address 2
city
state
postal code
country
email address
home phone
facebook page url
cell phone
userid
password
Using SQL (try using the phpMyAdmin interface, rather than the command line interface, but be sure to type in your SQL regardless), write code to create and populate the database with at least 10 rows of data.

Perform at least 2 distinct queries of your database and display results based on those queries.

Your grade will be assessed based upon your utilization of SQL. Provide an html page that display a link to a working url for your SQL coding and screenshots of the output.  Also, provide the SQL you used to do your queries and the results of those queries.

Bottom line?  What I expect from each student for this lab is an html file/URL that you will post whereby, on that html file, I will see:

1. link to your CREATE TABLE sql code that you used to build your table (this could be a link to a text file)

2. link to your INSERT INTO sql code that you used to place data in your table (this could be a link to a text file)

3. link to your FIRST QUERY sql code (again, a link to a text file)

4. link to your SECOND QUERY sql code (again a link to a text file)

5. link to a screenshot of the output of your first query (a link to an image file)

6. link to a screenshot of the output of your second query (a link to an image file)
