Lab 8: Working with Files

For this lab, you are to use HTML, CSS, and PHP to create a "guest book" where the user enters information into a form and provides some feedback/comments at the bottom of the form.  Clicking a "submit" button would then send the data to a file.

The design and format is entirely up to you.....make it "pleasing to the eye" for the end-user.

Lab will be assessed on your proper utilization of HTML, CSS, and PHP file functions.

The form MUST ask for: first name, last name, address, school attending, and a comment. (or if you prefer, you could modify each of these 5 data items); and it MUST ask for AT LEAST 4 additional items (like email address, facebook page URL, phone number, major, GPA, status (freshman, junior, etc)...and so forth)

Also, besides providing links to text versions of your php files, you should also provide links to the .mas and the .html file that gets created to show me that it did indeed work.

The ".mas" file is basically a text-based data file of all the submissions that will be made using the form you create.  The ".html" file is an html file that will display the last entry made on your form - or if you prefer, you can modify the code to display all the content that's in your data file.
