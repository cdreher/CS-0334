Lab 3 - PHP Testing

To get started with PHP, and prepare for future assignments:
1. download and install XAMPP to either your local machine or a USB drive.
2. obtain an account on a third party web host (like x10hosting.com or bluehosting or godaddy)
3. create the "Tip of the Day" program on page 19 in the book, except you are to use external CSS for the various colors and styles (see also: lab3_instructions_book_page19.pdf )
4. save a version of your code as a .txt file, and then place a line of html code near the top of the page with a hyperlink to the text file, so that I can review all your php code.
5. upload all the files created for "Tip of the Day" to your remote host, and submit the URL below so I can review your coding.
